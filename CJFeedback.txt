Ight CJ here w/an epic review:

- this is a really funny idea-- I love how you took the like basic "college app but make it tinder" but reversed it w/content. The "reach", "likely", "target" for people is pretty funny.

- IK you can search for people and add more, but I'd love to see the actual sorting function in a more clean manner instead of just typing it in--like more keyword stuff in the search bar

- def may be some ethical issues here.... yk like,, having a roster of women with some being sorted into likely (including the weight preferences :skull:) & promoting finding matches (and potentially dating) through a school-created website may not go over well with the HW authorities. To lessen the more harsh rankings I would also make it open to discovering friends too, because at least then it's a little less of a blow to the ego when it says "unlikely" & it'll prob be more likely to pass as an acceptable & ethical idea.

- def would like to see profiles of people, or maybe could combine stuff w/scoir features too?? for example like suggested reply times based on the persons texting history, more profile stuff avalible, delievered - read - need to respond, or even suggestions from your friends & stats of "past relationships"

- should be a way to verify the popularity & attractiveness of the other person, maybe add smthn like if you're looking at someone on your list you can rank them on your own & it takes other ppls rankings into account to get a better feel for yours.

- would people be able to see if you're considering them?? Is there continued interest?
